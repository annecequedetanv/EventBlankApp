EventBlank iOS App
==================

I go to a lot of conferences and events and noticed that few of them have a
proper iPhone app.

And I can understand that - there are so many things the organizers have to take
care of … and a nice app takes a lot of time do develop.

My goal with this project is to provide a free open source blueprint, which will
allow creating an event/conference iPhone app in a matter of \~ 1 hour. The
project will aim to have as few as possible dependanies so that it can be cloned
from GitHub and built immediately.

This project is currently in **alpha** stage. You will need Xcode 6.4 for
building it.
