  * Rewrote beginning of Entities section, clarifying that only
    entities not in code blocks or spans are decoded.
  * Removed defective Example 449 (#284).
  * Fixed typo (#283).
  * Added intended two-space hard-breaks in Examples 521, 523.
  * Clarified that brackets in general don't take precedence over emph
    (#258).
  * Clarified that final newline is removed from paragraph content
    (#176).
  * Talk of "info string" rather than "attributes" for code blocks
    (#262).
  * Clarified precedence of code spans, HTML tags, autolinks (#259).
  * Fixed a number of internal links and duplicate references in the spec.
  * Linkify "info string" in spec.
  * Use shortcut reference links when possible in spec.txt.
  * cmark itself is now used to build spec.html, rather than pandoc.
  * Use shortcut reference links when possible in spec.txt. This
    relies on the new `spec2md.py` behavior of creating references
    for all internal anchors.
  * Moved some examples from block to inline HTML section.
  * Added examples of non-comments (#264).
  * Changed rule for comments to conform to HTML5 spec.
  * Made clear that any sequence of characters is a valid document
    (#266).
  * Changed wording: "is preferred" -> "takes precedence."
  * Regularized spelling of "non-space character" and added links
    (#260).
  * Use four spaces rather than five to show "four spaces is too much"
    (#261).

  * Fixed some typos with "left-" and "right-flanking" delimiters in the
    section on emphasis and strong emphasis (#257).

  * Clarified indented code blocks. Previously the spec said, wrongly,
    that a blank line was needed between a paragraph and a following
    code block.  It is only needed between a code block and a following
    paragraph (due to lazy continuations). (Thanks to textnut.)
  * Added definitions of whitespace, unicode whitespace, punctuation,
    ASCII punctuation (#108).
  * Improved rules for emphasis and strong emphasis. This improves
    parsing of emphasis around punctuation. For background see
    <http://talk.commonmark.org/t/903/6>. The basic idea of the change
    is that if the delimiter is part of a delimiter clump that has
    punctuation to the left and a normal character (non-space,
    non-punctuation) to the right, it can only be an opener.  If it has
    punctuation to the right and a normal character (non-space,
    non-punctuation) to the left, it can only be a closer. This handles
    cases like

          **Gomphocarpus (*Gomphocarpus physocarpus*, syn. *Asclepias
          physocarpa*)**

    and

          **foo "*bar*" foo**

    better than before.
  * Added test case for link-in-link-in-image (#252).
  * Fixed broken internal references.
  * Added another example of an unclarity in the canonical Markdown
    syntax description.
  * Reworded the principle of uniformity to be more general; it applies
    to all container blocks, not just list items.
  * Added a rule for empty list items (#242).
  * Clarified precedence of empty list items over setext header lines
    (#95).
  * Added an example with two blank lines in fenced code in a sublist (#180).
  * Added an explicit CC-BY-SA license to the spec (#55).

[0.13]

  * Updated path of test program.
  * Use terminology "plain textual content" instead of "string."
  * Added condition that conforming parsers strip or replace NULL characters.
  * Changed Example 196 to reflect the spec's rules.  It should not be a loose
    list as it has no blank lines.
  * Adjusted semantically insignificant formatting of HTML output.
  * Added example to spec of shortcut link with following space (#214).
